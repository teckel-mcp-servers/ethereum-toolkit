# ethereum-toolkit
This MCP server provides access to a subset of the teckel web3 Ethereum JSON-RPC services—namely those that require read only access to the blockchain (Mainnet and Sepolia).

The main purpose of the ethereum toolkit is to give LLM/AI/Agents real-time access to Ethereum blockchain basic information. Once connected to an LLM via your MCP-client-of-choice, the LLM can use the suite of tools in the toolbox to provide answers to prompts such as:

“What is the current Ethereum price in USD on the mainnet and the sepolia testnet?”

“What is the current Ethereum gas price on the mainnet and the sepolia testnet?”

“What is the balance of my Ethereum Account on the mainnet and the sepolia testnet?”

“What transactions have been processed in the latest block on the mainnet and the sepolia testnet?”
